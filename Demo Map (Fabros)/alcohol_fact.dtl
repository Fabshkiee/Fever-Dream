character: Hmm… alcohol. In my world, we sometimes use it for cleaning wounds, but only when it’s the strong medical kind. This bottle? Way too weak for that.
character: See, the real danger in a place like this isn’t wild animals — it’s infection. A tiny cut can turn deadly if bacteria get in. Back home, we have antibiotics and hospitals. Here? You’ve got to rely on basics\: boiled water, clean cloth, and keeping wounds covered.
character: People in medieval times didn’t know about germs, but we do. Stay clean, treat injuries fast, and remember — prevention is always easier than curing an infection.
